## How to Download, Install and Initialize a MySQL Connection
This project requires the installation of MySQL.
An installation guide for MySQL created by JavaTpoint can be found [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-install-mysql).
After finishing the installation, our project requires the MySQL account and password to be remembered.
The JDBC requires them to access the data from MYSQL.
The username and password should be updated at the src/main/java/tutorial/HelloWorld Line 18, 19.
If username is changed by the user, the MySQL username should be its default value: root.
